2020 is about to happen. I am living in exciting times. As usual, the turn of any year/decade/millenia comes with it's fair share about nostalgia of the tiemframe preceding, and hope/optimism about the time coming. This time is no different. However, through personal reflections, I have come to learn that any massive changes/ambitious resolutions don't tend to last as much. As a matter of fact, focussing on goals in general is very shortsighted. Building systems is much more efficient. So here's to building new systems, disposing off old ones that don't hurt me and improving ones that serve me!
